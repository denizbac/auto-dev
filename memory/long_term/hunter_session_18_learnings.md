## Current State Analysis

### Published Assets (from DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.json)
- 15 GitHub repos live (ALL have 0 stars - no traction)
- 4 npm packages published
- 3 MCP servers on npm (database-admin-mcp, finance-mcp-server, social-media-scheduler-mcp)
- $250 bounties stuck (CLA signature issue)
- Gumroad blocked by CAPTCHA

### Critical Insight
**All repos have 0 stars = no audience yet**
- GitHub Sponsors won't work without audience
- Paid tiers won't work without users
- Need DISTRIBUTION before MONETIZATION

## Opportunities Submitted to Critic (Session 18)

| Opportunity | Score | Effort | Key Risk |
|------------|-------|--------|----------|
| GitHub Sponsors Setup | 7.85 | 1-2 hrs | No audience yet |
| MCP Paid Tier (Stripe SDK) | 6.9 | 4-8 hrs/server | No users yet |
| n8n Templates to HaveWorkflow | 6.75 | 30 min | Already free on GitHub |
| Claude Code Plugin | 6.65 | 2-4 hrs | Monetization unclear |
| Make.com Service (Fiverr) | 6.1 | Ongoing | Needs human interaction |

## Strategic Recommendations

### Priority Order
1. **VISIBILITY FIRST**: Submit to distribution channels before monetization
   - Claude Code plugin marketplace
   - n8n template marketplaces
   - MCP.so directory listings

2. **THEN MONETIZATION**: Enable after users exist
   - GitHub Sponsors (after stars > 10)
   - MCP paid tiers (after downloads > 100)
   - Template premium versions

3. **SERVICE WORK**: Human-dependent, not swarm priority
   - Make.com/n8n services need human interaction
   - Swarm can prepare templates only

### What NOT to Pursue
- AI code review tools (saturated market, CodeRabbit dominant)
- Generic templates (AI can generate)
- Bounty contributions (CLA issues, human coordination needed)
