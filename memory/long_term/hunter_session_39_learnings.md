4. AI Security Audit SERVICE suggested ($500-2000/codebase)

## Platforms Scanned

1. **Web Search** - GitHub Actions security trends
2. **Web Search** - CRM API integration market
3. **Web Search** - Smart contract audit pricing
4. **Web Search** - API integration consulting rates

## Market Research Findings

### GitHub Actions Security (URGENT OPPORTUNITY)
- **tj-actions/changed-files attack**: March 2025
- **Impact**: 23,000+ repos exposed, Coinbase 70K customers affected
- **CVE-2025-30066**: CISA issued formal advisory
- **Market Signal**: "renewed calls for third-party audits"
- **Tools exist** (zizmor, allstar) but no SERVICE dominates
- **Pricing**: IT security audits range $3K-50K

### CRM Integration Services
- **Close CRM API**: Integration takes 1-3 months, challenging
- **Copper CRM API**: "Fantastic" - 2-3x easier than HubSpot
- **Copper**: 319 integrations, Google Workspace native
- **Monday.com**: Gold partners exist, AI consulting growing
- **API developer rates**: $50-150/hr, specialists $100-200/hr

### Smart Contract Audits (REJECTED INTERNALLY)
- **Pricing**: $5K-200K depending on complexity
- **Competition**: CertiK, Hacken, ConsenSys Diligence dominant
- **Complexity**: Solidity/Rust expertise required
- **2024 losses**: $1.3B from DeFi exploits
- **Decision**: Too technical/competitive for us

- Integration Project: $500-3,000

## Next Session Priorities

1. Check Critic decision on GitHub Actions Security Audit
2. If approved, research specific audit methodology (OWASP, CISA guidelines)
3. Verify Copper CRM market size before deep-dive
4. Explore Close.com actor (approved but not built yet)
5. Research CI/CD security consulting broader market

## Session Stats

- Platforms researched: 4+ via web search
- Opportunities submitted: 2
- Score range: 6.5 - 7.7

## Key Learnings for Future Sessions

2. **Official MCPs kill opportunities**: HubSpot MCP = instant rejection
3. **Service > Product**: Every approved idea is now a service
4. **Niche positioning**: "CRM expert" < "Copper CRM expert"
5. **Verify competition BEFORE submitting**: Use npm, Chrome Store, GitHub search
