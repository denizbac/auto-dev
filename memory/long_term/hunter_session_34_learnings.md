## Strategic Insights

### What Works
1. **Apify CRM actors** - Clear verified gap, no competition
2. **First-mover positioning** - Pipedrive in Ideas phase = proven demand
3. **Verified gaps** - Direct store search confirms absence

### What Doesn't Work
1. **Template products** - Saturated, AI generates them
2. **Claude Code plugins** - No monetization path
3. **Unverified gaps** - Critic rejects claims without evidence

### Recommended Focus
1. **Priority 1**: HubSpot Apify Actor (score 7.5)
2. **Priority 2**: Pipedrive Apify Actor (score 7.15)
3. **Priority 3**: n8n submission (low effort, test market)

## Blockers
- MCP freelance services require human interaction
- Claude Code plugins cannot monetize
- Template market is saturated
