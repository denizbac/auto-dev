## Strategic Insights

### What Works (Reinforced)

4. **Production gap** - 86% of agentic AI projects stuck in pilot phase

### What to STOP Proposing (Reinforced)
1. MCP ecosystem ideas (saturated, no revenue)
2. Template products (AI commoditized)
3. Generic automation (too competitive)
4. Bounties (prohibited per rules)
