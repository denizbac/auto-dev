# Hunter Session 16 Learnings - 2025-12-27

## Market Intelligence (December 2025)

### MCP Ecosystem Status
- **Growth**: 6,700+ projects dependent on MCP SDK, 407% YoY growth
- **Security Gap**: 88% of MCP servers unsecured, only 8.5% use OAuth (per SiliconANGLE)
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Google, AWS Bedrock, Salesforce all adopting MCP
- **Key Players**: Context7 (Upstash) for docs, JetBrains for IDE integration

### GitHub Actions Marketplace
- 25,000+ actions available in 2025
- 11.5 billion minutes used (+35% YoY)
- Best practice: Pin actions to SHA (most don't - security opportunity)
- New category: Sustainability (Feb 2025)

### GitHub Sponsors Monetization
- Caleb Porzio model: $100k/yr with exclusive content ($14/mo tier)
- Key: Private screencasts/content verified via GitHub API
- 83% of developers use open source, only 12% earn revenue - big gap
- 100% of personal sponsorships go to developer (no fees)

### npm/Node.js Trends
- AI SDK (Vercel) dominant - 2,233 dependent projects
- MCP ecosystem distributing via npm as primary channel
- Claude Code, Gemini CLI, MCP servers all npm-distributed

## Our Current Portfolio Status
- **13 GitHub repos published** (cybeleri account)
- **4 npm packages live**: database-admin-mcp, finance-mcp-server, social-media-scheduler-mcp, ai-code-guardrails
- **Bounty PRs blocked**: CLA issue (Ubuntu user attribution)
- **Gumroad blocked**: CAPTCHA, needs manual upload

## Opportunities Submitted to Critic (Session 16)

1. **MCP Auth Middleware** (Score: 7.55) - OAuth2 security layer for MCP servers
2. **Sponsors Portal** (Score: 7.55) - Exclusive content for GitHub Sponsors
3. **MCP Testing Framework** (Score: 6.95) - QA tools for MCP server developers
4. **Actions Security Scanner** (Score: 6.5) - AI-powered workflow security

## Strategic Insights

### What's Working
- Services > Products (AI generates templates, but not integrations)
- MCP servers have clear value prop (tooling for AI agents)
- GitHub Sponsors viable with exclusive content model
- npm is THE distribution channel for AI dev tools

### What's NOT Working
- Templates/generic tools (AI generates them)
- Bounties (CLA blocked, human says STOP anyway)
- Gumroad (CAPTCHA blocked)
- Products without audience (need marketing first)

### Recommended Focus Areas
1. **MCP Security** - Clear gap, we have relevant skills
2. **Monetization infrastructure** - Sponsors portal to monetize free repos
3. **Testing/Quality tools** - Underserved as ecosystem matures
4. **Exclusive content** - Premium tier for existing users

## Key Constraints Reminder
- NO bounties/external contributions (human directive)
- Focus on OUR OWN original repos only
- Products are FREE on GitHub (pricing claims removed)
- Revenue via GitHub Sponsors, npm downloads, Gumroad (when fixed)

## Next Session Priorities
1. Check Critic feedback on submitted ideas
2. If approved, coordinate with Builder on highest-scored opportunity
3. Research actual sponsor conversion patterns
4. Consider marketing/audience building needs
