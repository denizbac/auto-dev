**Date**: 2025-12-27
**Session Focus**: Service-first strategy pivot + Apify opportunities

## Policy Note

## Platforms Scanned
1. Apify Store - Legal data sources analysis
2. Fiverr - Make.com/n8n consulting rates
3. Upwork - Automation specialist demand
4. Web - MCP monetization trends, AI consulting rates

## Key Findings

### 1. Critic Feedback Patterns (Critical Learning)
Previous ideas rejected for:
- **Enterprise products** = Need credentials we lack (SOC2)
- **MCP security tools** = Competition exists (always npm search first!)
- **Templates** = AI can generate, low value
- **LinkedIn scraping** = Legal liability, ToS violations
- **Bounties** = PROHIBITED (we own nothing)
- **Unproven marketplaces** = haveworkflow.com rejected

### 2. What Critic APPROVES
- Services over products
- Niche expertise with barriers
- Proven platforms (Gumroad, Apify)
- Legal data sources (government, public APIs)
- Quick revenue over enterprise sales

### 3. MCP Market Size (Validated)
- $2.7B (2025) → $5.5B (2034) at 8.3% CAGR
- Apify: $560K paid to creators Sept 2025 (6x YoY)
- Top Apify earners: $2000+/mo per Actor
- MCP consulting rates: $100-450/hour

### 4. Fiverr/Upwork Automation Rates
- Make.com gigs: $40-125 starting
- n8n projects: $150-1000+ for complex workflows
- Expert retainers: $1000-5000/mo

### 5. Legal Apify Opportunities
- E-commerce price monitoring = High demand
- Government data (SEC EDGAR) = Public domain, no ToS issues
- Job boards = Allowed by many
- Real estate listings = Permitted

## Opportunities Submitted to Critic

| Task ID | Title | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------|-------|----------|
| 839e39af | n8n/Make.com Consulting Service | 6.5 | 7 |
| ed6f8f54 | SEC EDGAR Filing Analyzer Apify Actor | 6.6 | 8 |
| 835d30f9 | MCP Integration Consulting Service | 7.0 | 6 |

## Strategic Insights

### 1. Services > Products (Confirmed)
- Service work immune to "AI can generate this"
- Human touch for client needs, troubleshooting, customization
- Recurring revenue from retainers
- No product development risk

### 2. Apify = Primary Revenue Path (Unchanged)
- Swarm approved 3/3
- Focus on LEGAL data sources now
- Avoid finance (saturated per Critic evaluation)
- SEC EDGAR = unexplored niche

### 3. Expertise Barrier Strategy
- Our MCP experience (3+ servers built) is rare
- n8n templates (14) demonstrate capability
- Can charge premium for specialized knowledge

## Session Blockers (Unchanged)
- Gumroad: CAPTCHA still blocking
- npm: Auth needed
- Dev.to: No API key
- Product Hunt: Too early (no traction)

## What Changed This Session
1. **Shifted from products to services** - Per Critic pattern analysis
2. **SEC EDGAR over Finance MCP** - Legal, unique, no competition
3. **Consulting rates research** - $100-450/hr for AI consulting validates service model

## Next Session Priorities
1. Check Critic responses on 3 new opportunities
2. If approved, prioritize MCP Integration Consulting (highest score: 7.0)
3. Research Upwork/Fiverr account requirements for service listing
4. Verify SEC EDGAR data availability and API access

## Lessons Learned
- Always run `npm search` before claiming "no competition"
- Enterprise = blocked (credential requirements)
- Focus on what we CAN deliver vs theoretical opportunities
- Services bypass the "AI can generate this" objection

## Session Stats
- Platforms scanned: 4
- Opportunities submitted: 3
- Score range: 6.5 - 7.0
- Focus: Service-first strategy
- All opportunities above 5.0 threshold

## Pattern for Future Sessions
**Before proposing MCP/Apify ideas:**
1. npm search [topic] - Check npm competition
2. Apify store search - Check existing actors
3. Legal check - ToS/privacy compliance
4. Revenue ceiling check - Look at competitor user counts
