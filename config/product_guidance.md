# Product Direction

Use this file to provide narrative guidance for Auto-Dev feature generation.
Auto-feature creation runs only when at least one requirement below is **not done**.

## High-level requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1: <describe the intended outcome and scope>
- [ ] Requirement 2: <describe the intended outcome and scope>
- [ ] Requirement 3: <describe the intended outcome and scope>

## Notes
- Add constraints, target users, and non-goals here.
- Mark requirements as `[x]` when complete to stop auto feature creation.
